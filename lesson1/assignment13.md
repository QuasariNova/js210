1. Declare a variable named `numerator` and set it to 10.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
let numerator = 10;
```

---

2. Declare a constant named `DENOMINATOR` and set it to 2.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
const DENOMINATOR = 2;
```

---

3. Declare a variable named `answer` and set it to the result of `numerator` divided by `DENOMINATOR`. Log the value of `answer` (it should be 5).

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
let answer = numerator / DENOMINATOR;
console.log(answer);
```

---

4. Declare a variable named `incrementer` and set it to 1.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
let incrementer = 1;
```

---

5. Declare a variable named `start` and set it to `incrementer`.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
let start = incrementer;
```

---

6. Declare variables named `end` and `difference`. Leave them undefined.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
let end;
let difference;
```

---

7. Increment the `incrementer` variable by 1 three times using the self-addition notation.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
incrementer += 1;
incrementer += 1;
incrementer += 1;
```

---

8. Increment the `incrementer` variable by 1 twice using the increment operator shorthand.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
incrementer++;
++incrementer;
```

---

9. Set the value of `end` to `incrementer` and the value of `difference` to `end` minus `start`. Log the value of `end`, which should be 6. Log the value of `difference`, which should be 5.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
end = incrementer;
difference = end - start;

console.log(end);
console.log(difference);
```

---

10. Declare a variable named `answer` and initialize it to the result of 11 plus 31 multiplied by 3 as one statement, then log the result. Your result should be 126. If you get a different result, you may need to use some parentheses to change the order of operations: you want to perform the addition first, then the multiplication.

<br>
<br>
<br>

```js
let answer = (11 + 31) * 3;
console.log(answer);
```
